### Description for Git File

This Python script interacts with the Guerrilla Mail API to manage temporary email addresses. The script includes functions to create a temporary email address, check for incoming emails, and read the content of those emails. 

**Functionality:**

1. **`generate_random_string(length=10)`**:
   - Generates a random string of specified length (default is 10 characters) consisting of lowercase letters.
   
2. **`create_guerrilla_mail()`**:
   - Requests a new temporary email address from Guerrilla Mail.
   - Returns the generated email address and session ID token (`sid_token`) for further operations.
   - Handles exceptions if the request fails.

3. **`check_email(sid_token)`**:
   - Checks the Guerrilla Mail account for new emails using the provided `sid_token`.
   - Returns a list of emails received or an empty list if no emails are found.
   - Handles exceptions if the request fails.

4. **`read_email(email_id, sid_token)`**:
   - Retrieves the content of an email by its ID using the provided `sid_token`.
   - Returns the email content or `None` if an error occurs.
   - Handles exceptions if the request fails.

**Example Usage:**
- The script demonstrates how to create a temporary email address, wait for a short period to allow for incoming emails, check for any received emails, and then read and print the content of each email.

**Dependencies:**
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Guerrilla Mail API.
- `random`: For generating random strings.
- `string`: For accessing predefined string constants (e.g., lowercase letters).
- `time`: For adding delays.

**Notes:**
- Ensure the `requests` library is installed in your Python environment.
- The Guerrilla Mail API endpoints used are: 
  - `https://api.guerrillamail.com/ajax.php` for creating an email, checking emails, and reading email content.
- Adjust the sleep duration in the example usage according to your needs to wait for emails to arrive.
